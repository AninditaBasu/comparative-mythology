# Comparative mythology

What is mythology if not humankind's desperate attempt to make sense of Nature, an attempt that seeks to reassure them that doomsday is not near and that they can go on living their lives, minding their business because there will always be someone who helps them contend with the unforeseen. An attempt spans across regions and cultures, and lives through the oral transmission of stories. 

This website examines myths, not in their native contexts alone, but comparatively, and looks for similarities and differences. Because, what is human nature if not enduring and non-changing across cultures and regions?
